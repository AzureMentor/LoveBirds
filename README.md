What is Love (birds)? Oh Baby don't hurt me don't hurt me no more
It’s a standalone device to receive send voice messages with one person: lover, family or friend. Open the box, push on the button while you talk, release to send. Your correspondent will receive the voice message on his Telegram phone app or on his own LoveBirds box with a nice motor move and bird song.
Oh bloody hell just watch the video : XXX

Ok my phone can already do that, why should I bother?
It’s way easier to use than a phone, one button, cool for children, old people that don’t like smartphones, long distance relationships or just lovers that want a private line to talk to their second half.
It’s a dedicated device to privately chat with one person: less is more.
It’s not mobile so it’s like old landline phone, you take the time to answer from your sofa.
It’s so cute to see the thing turning when you receive a message when you come back home.
